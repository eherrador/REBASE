reB∆SE, pronounced "rebase" is a decentralized elastic supply protocol. It is forked from Ampleforth which operates under the codename "UFragments". This monetary protocol maintains a stable unit price by adjusting supply directly to and from wallet holders.

This repository is a collection of smart contracts that implement the reB∆SE protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.

The official contract addresses are:
- ERC-20 Token:  TBD
- Supply Policy: TBD
- Market Oracle: TBD
- CPI Oracle:    TBD
